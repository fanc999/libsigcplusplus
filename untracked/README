untracked/README

This directory contains files not tracked by a source code control program,
such as git. (This README file is the exception.)

The files can have one of two origins.

1. Copied by the mm-common-get command.
2. Generated when libsigc++ is built.

Files of type 2 exist here only if libsigc++ is built with maintainer-mode=false,
or the directory comes from a tarball.
Files of both types exist here only if libsigc++ is built with Meson,
or the tarball is created with Meson.

1. Files copied by mm-common-get
--------------------------------
untracked/docs/docs/doc-install.pl
                    doc-postprocess.pl
                    doxygen-extra.css

mm-common-get may copy more files, but they are not used by libsigc++.
